  - Body: for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal. Sincerely, Phillip Allen

  - Body: gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta). TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker. Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit and explicit position break out issues. -- Allan. PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport. Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that point.
