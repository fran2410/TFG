    "body": "Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.",

We've had \nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \ntraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\nWe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\n\nThings left to do:\nI think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \nproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \nproject and which fall out of scope.\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \ndrill downs.\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\n\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \nticker.\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \ntransport, swaps, options, ...\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \nshown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid \nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\nAbility to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \nappropriate positions to show for each:\nGas Daily for monthly index,\nPhysical gas for Nymex,\nPhysical gas for Inside Ferc,\nPhysical gas for Mid market.\nAbility for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of \nusing official valuations.\nPosition and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.\nAbility to include the Gas Price book into TDS:\nInclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility \nskew and correlations.\nAbility to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  \nApproximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a \ngamma grid.\nValuation of Gas Daily options.\nA new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.\nInclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.\nAbility to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position \nmanager.\nAbility to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, \nprior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.\nEliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.\nPosition drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of \nindividual deals on the position total in a grid cell.\nBenchmark positions in TDS.\nDeployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit \nand explicit position break out issues.\n\n-- Allan.\n\nPS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for \ntransport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that \npoint.",

It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \nproject and which fall out of scope.\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \ndrill downs.\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\n\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \nticker.\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \ntransport, swaps, options, ...\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \nshown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid \nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\nAbility to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \nappropriate positions to show for each:\nGas Daily for monthly index,\nPhysical gas for Nymex,\nPhysical gas for Inside Ferc,\nPhysical gas for Mid market.\nAbility for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of \nusing official valuations.\nPosition and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.\nAbility to include the Gas Price book into TDS:\nInclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility \nskew and correlations.\nAbility to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  \nApproximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a \ngamma grid.\nValuation of Gas Daily options.\nA new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.\nInclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.\nAbility to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position \nmanager.\nAbility to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, \nprior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.\nEliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.\nPosition drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of \nindividual deals on the position total in a grid cell.\nBenchmark positions in TDS.\nDeployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit \nand explicit position break out issues.\n\n-- Allan.\n\nPS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for \ntransport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that \npoint.",

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 \n04:28 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"Claudia L. Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.

As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 \n04:26 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"Claudia L. Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".

After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding \nas far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like \nanything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate \nclosing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? \n?\nIf this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is \nno point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? \n?\nI will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and \nfind out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.\n?\nI guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable \ndocument or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? \nThis isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last \nnight but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said \nthis is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? \n?\nI will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at \nthat but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even \nneeded to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any \nneed to contact me regarding the  closing.\n?\nI really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself \nand I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't \nseem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my \nsignature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it \nreviewed before I accept it.\n?\nBrenda\n?\n?",

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000 \n04:35 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\n\n\nEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\nthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/11/2000 \n04:57 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\n\n\nEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\nthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/08/2000 \n12:28 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\n\n\nEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\nthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. \"That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \nheads. \n\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \nUtilities and\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \ndata centers. The\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing \nresidential and business\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \nnecessary to support\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \nmillion each,\n                  Karzmar said. \n\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \nbring up the data center\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \n\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \nbusinesses and schools in the\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \n\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \nappetite for power --\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \nfacilities run 24 hours a\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \nconstant revenue\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \nthey could\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \nexpenditures. \n\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \nmean for power rates\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \n\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \nCity Light. \n\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \nlights at the football\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \nWe have data\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \nand 50 megawatts.\" \n\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \ncomplex in Tukwila is\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \nthe 1.35 million\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \nBoeing Space &\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \n92 percent of the\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \ncompanies. \n\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \nCommunications,\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \nNetworks all\n                  lease space in the office park. \n\n                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \nSabey has become an\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \nmanagement or\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \nclaims his firm is\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \nthe country. \n\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \nbandwidth-heavy tasks\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \nco-location space in\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \n\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \nspace is growing at a\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \ncausing similar\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \nCalifornia. \n\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \nspace, plans to nearly\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \nWhile companies\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \nhigh-tech companies\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \nas Exodus that\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \nmanagement. \n\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \nconstruction and we plan to\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \ndemand right now\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \nexecutive at Exodus in\n                  Seattle. \n\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \nin the local utility\n                  industry perplexed. \n\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \nto serve the growth,\"\n                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is \nalmost stunned by this, in\n                  a way.\"",

I have asked Zimin Lu \n(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they \nwill be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this \nmeeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is \ncomfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those \nwho are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have \nheard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to \ndiscuss them.\n\nPlease let me know if you are unable to attend.",

 If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS \ninformation, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed \nas soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days \nago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to \ncall Ted Bland @ 3-5275.\n\nWith Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees \nbetween operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to \nhave one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee \ndata.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the \nyear-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC \nrequests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their \nprofiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education \nneed to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is \naccessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to \nhrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com \non the command line of your browser.\n\nThe target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would \nlike to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned \nfor input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please \ncontact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  \n\nYour  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave",

The \nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \nthe generation side.\n\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \nthey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \nothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas \ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \nespecially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the \nUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal \nconsumer then it is obviously a different story.\n\nLet's talk.",

Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.\n\nBid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/30/2000 \n01:32 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Colleen Sullivan                           05/30/2000 09:18 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Transport p&l\n\nPhillip--\nI've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange \nto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI'll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019.   \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \ncase there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the \nvolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. \n \nDeal #  251327                  159540                   265229         \n106300   201756\nP&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)          \n($2,769)   ($273)\nRec:   Ques/Clay Basin/0184   NWPL/Opal 543  NWPL/Opal   Sumas      NWPL/S of \nGr Rvr\nDel:   NWPL/S of Green River/Clay   Ques/Clay Basin/0852   Ques/Clay \nBasin/0852   Ques/Clay Basin    Ques/Clay Basin\n1        329       8,738\n2     1,500\n3         2,974    11,362\n4         6,741    12,349       1,439\n5       19,052          3,183\n9            333\n13  30,863       2,680\n14  30,451    \n15  35,226    \n16         6,979              235 \n17  17,464     \n18    9,294     \n20  10,796          771\n21  17,930     \n22  10,667     \n23       14,415          9,076\n25  23,934       8,695\n26     3,284     \n27         1,976\n28     1,751     \n29     1,591     \n30  20,242",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

They were polite regarding \nasset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to \nlisten to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to \nprotect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality \nagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable \nus to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder \nvalue by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by \nreducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a \nweather product.\n\nAs to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other \ncandidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy \nto ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our \nopportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we \nimplement our strategy in California.\n\nAre there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset \nmanagement deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to \nsystematically identify and work through all the candidates. \n\nLaird",

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird",

But that's not how shockwave.com operates.\nShockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is\nnow free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?\nGet Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your\nShockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.\nhttp://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351629\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLick the Frog.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYou're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.\nYou've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome\nprince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping\nthrough the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for\nlaundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.\nhttp://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351630\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBusiness Meeting or Missile Command?

Any possibility for a \ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \ndifficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \ndisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the \ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should \nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n \nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n \nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\nCurrent Projected \nBlended IR:  5.38%\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \nidea  earlier in the crisis.\n \nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.",

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook \nclient will be configured on your computer.\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail \nvia Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is \nconfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is \nmigrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your \nweb browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and \nTo-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook \nclient is configured on your desktop.\n\n2. Remote access to your mailbox.\nAfter your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) \nfor remote access to your mailbox.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while \nconnecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA \navailable from your home or when traveling abroad.\n\nHOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\n\nLaunch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  \nhttp://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\n\nSubstitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You \nwill be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user \nid\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You \nwill now be able to view your mailbox.\n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between \nthe Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things \nin OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the \nfunctions NOT available via OWA:\n\nFeatures NOT available using OWA:\n\n-  Tasks\n-  Journal\n-  Spell Checker\n-  Offline Use\n-  Printing Templates\n-  Reminders\n-  Timed Delivery\n-  Expiration\n-  Outlook Rules\n-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall\n-  Sharing Contacts with others\n-  Task Delegation\n-  Direct Resource Booking\n-  Personal Distribution Lists\n\nQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\n\nIf you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the \nOutlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:\n\n Outlook.2000@enron.com\n\nOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:\n\n 713-853-1411\n\nThank you,\n\nOutlook 2000 Migration Team",

They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  \n\nCan you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from \nthe distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you \nplease email them to me as well?\n\nThank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.\n\nPhillip Allen",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \nout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \nif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \nagenda.  Hope this info helps.

At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \nquestions or need any further information.",

Center Garage\n\nThe Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.\n\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\n\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \nemployee cost of $94.00.\n\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \nas spaces become available. \n\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \n\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \ngarage.\n\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \n\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)",

Any experience with FHA \n221(d) loans?  \n\nAlthough your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market \nquotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:\n\n  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment\n  2%- overhead\n  4%- profit\n\nI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an \nextremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even \nreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only \ngenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about \nsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down \nto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?\n\nI realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you \nlocal connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of \nthe office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.\n\nPhillip",

    "body": "Cary,\n\nHere is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple\nfarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.\n\nA few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:\n\nThere will be a double porch across the back just like the front\nNo dormers (Metal roof)\n1/2 bath under stairs\nOverall dimensions are 55 by 40\n\n\nWhat I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More\ncabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.\nReagan\nsuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want\nto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about\nbringing the left\nside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.\nThat might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front\nporch would\nbe smaller.\n\nI have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead\nand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a\nbuilder.\nI just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned\nmy alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed\nsketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan\nallowed.\n\nPhillip Allen\n713-853-7041\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/29/2001 \n10:17 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nHunter S Shively\n03/26/2001 10:01 AM\nTo: phillip.k.allen@enron.com\ncc:  \nSubject:",

    "body": "Reagan,\n\nThank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a \nlist of questions on the specs:\n\n1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less \nand cost about the same?\n\n2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory \njoist?\n\n3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?\n\n4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What \ntype of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or \nCellulose?\n\n5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?\n\n6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know \nthe difference between an apron and a stool.\n\n7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent \ncracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?\n\n8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial \none out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.\n\n9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under \nthe stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.\n\n10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount \nstainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.\n\n11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.\n\n12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?\n\n13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?\n\n14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron \nrailings?\n\n15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except \nfor change orders?\n\nI want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but \nthis is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to \ncall Cary Kipp to\nsee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.\n\nPhillip\nI",

You mentioned 2% \noverhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.\n\nWhy is profit only 4%? \n\nWhy are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.\n\nWhat is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to \nboost loan amount but not a real cost?\n\nTotal Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who \nreceives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?\n\nWhere is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?\n\nWhat is the status on the operating pro forma?

My only comment is that George and Larry might \nobject to the language that \"the bank that was requested to finance the \nconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs \nof the construction of the Project\".   Technically, that bank lowered the \nloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of \nequity that would be required. \n\nDid I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.\n\nRegarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, \nengineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are \nin a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking \ndirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on \nwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  \n\nThe obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we \nneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and \ngive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.\n\nPhillip",

According to BPA,\nit had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet\nbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in\norder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had\nbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that the\nsales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.\n\nCal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than\nyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.\nYesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because\nof concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending\nexchange energy into California, however.\n\nMore details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the\nWestern Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.",

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \ncurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\n\nActing in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \nproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \nand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \nour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \nrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \n\nTwo methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \npercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \nyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \nor $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \nsecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \nyear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \nvaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \nforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \nthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \nprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \nmonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the \nattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings \nthe total net buyout to $78,946.? \n\nWe still believe that this project needs the professional services that we \noffer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout \noffer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are \nprepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? \nIf this is your \n\n\n\nchoice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, \nClaudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then \ndraft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the \nBishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout \namount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.\n\nThank you.\n\n?\n\nSincerely,\n\n[IMAGE]\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nGeorge W.

He has also completed a \ntopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to \ncoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the \nsmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going \nto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to \ncomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which \n$14,000 are due now for work completed.  \n\nWe are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by \nthe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.

I spoke to him about the possibility of your call \nand he was fine with that.  \n\nNow we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp \nFlores can be used.\n\nKeith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.

I am ready to offer my version or threaten to \nforeclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  \nSince their cost\nand fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I \nwouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I \nwant to respond to their offer asap.\n\nCall me with your thoughts.\n\nPhillip\n\n\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/14/2001 \n08:36 AM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 03/13/2001 11:29:49 PM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>, \"Keith Holst\" <kholst@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <LLEWTER@austin.rr.com>, \"Claudia L.

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \ncurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\n\nActing in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \nproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \nand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \nour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \nrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \n\nTwo methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \npercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \nyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \nor $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \nsecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \nyear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \nvaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \nforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \nthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \nprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \nmonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the \nattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings \nthe total net buyout to $78,946.? \n\nWe still believe that this project needs the professional services that we \noffer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout \noffer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are \nprepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? \nIf this is your \n\n\n\nchoice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, \nClaudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then \ndraft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the \nBishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout \namount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.\n\nThank you.\n\n?\n\nSincerely,\n\n[IMAGE]\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nGeorge W.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \n500+\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \nthis,\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\n\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\n\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\n\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\n\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\nturn over.\n\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\n\n4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \ndebt\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\n\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\n\n6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\nequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\n\n     Land -                   $1,121,670\n     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\n     Cash Equity              $1,419,268\n     Total                    $2,955,938\n\n7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage \nof\nactual hard construction costs.\n\n(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)\n\n\n\n\n - MAPTTRA.xls",

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from\nKeith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in\nthe transaction.\n\n2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) \nwill\nbe in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the\nacceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma\nperformance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit\nofficer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer\nsigning off on the deal.\n\n3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers\ndeferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as\ndeferred profit has been acceptable.\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew Ozuna\nReal Estate Loan Officer\n210-271-8386\n##",

They do not want the school\nto come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet\nwith a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the\nsubject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF\nwants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,\nand explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.\n\nAMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after\nthe March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.\n\nThe Stage is still on go.

Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, \nTAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the \n       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and \nTAGG but the issues facing \n       scheduling in Unify are grey.\n\n2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the \"assume it is messed up\" \npolicy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need \nfurther      scrutiny.\n\n3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical \nimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?\n\n4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training \ncourses, review progress and make cuts.\n\n5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at \neverything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add \n   some value and direction to the group.\n\n\nIn fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD \nto work part time to get it done.\n\nPhillip",

Their version includes the salary of a \nsuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third \nparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" \nfees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be \npaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally \nthe builders profit of 1.4 million.\n\nKeith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out \nof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if \nthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  \nWe were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition \nto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been \nin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and \nthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management \nfee is included.\n\nGeorge gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will \nreview and let you know what I think.\n\nThe GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to \nthe 3 out 4 approval process.\n\nLet me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only \ntrue costs + 1.4 million.\n\nPhillip",

If they can really build this \nmany plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously \nit is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard \nto envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is \nsubscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the \nEl Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.\n\n\nMark\n\n\n----- Forwarded by Mark Whitt/NA/Enron on 02/09/2001 03:04 PM -----\n\n\tTyrell Harrison@ECT\n\tSent by: Tyrell Harrison@ECT\n\t02/09/2001 09:26 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mark Whitt/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul T \nLucci/NA/Enron@Enron, Kim Ward/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie \nMiller/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: California Gas Demand Growth\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to run sensitivities to heat rate and daily dispatch,  I have \nattached the spreadsheet below.\n\n\nTyrell\n303 575 6478",

This needs to be written in on their lease.\n\nWhen you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize \nthat it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  \n\nHave my Dad read the memo before you put it out.

I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank \nis showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the \nspreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.\n\n2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?\n\n3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?\n\n4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?\n\n5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?\n\n6.  #14  missed on 2/2?\n\n7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?\n\n8.  #20a missed on 2/2?\n\n9.  #35 missed on 2/2?\n\nMy guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  \nYou may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that I don't remember on \nsome of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the \nbank deposit.\n\nWill have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade \nlast night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?\n\n5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.\n\nWith regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a \nsolid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes \ncosts.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\nBut that still wasn't enough juice.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\n$250/MWh price cap.\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\nPowerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\nWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\nwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\nDorinson said.\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\nthe high-priced power.\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\nPwr Plant\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\nCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\nISO.\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\ncollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling\nblackouts.\nThe ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),\nReliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).\nDuke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives\nin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.\n\n\n   -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line\nPower Plants\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\n\n   By Jessica Berthold\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said\nWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by\nsome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate\nreasons.\nThe California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power\ngrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public\nUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power\nplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,\nISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nThe state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for\nunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency\nfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and\ncustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be\ncalled on to do so.\nAs reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)\nsaid they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday\nevening.\nRepresentatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES\nand Dynegy Tuesday evening.\nAES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection\nof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday\nmorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron\nThomas said.\nThomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives\nreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.\n\n   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits\n\nThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have\nused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\nThomas said.\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\nand Redondo Beach plants.\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\n\"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\"\nThomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\ndistrict's\" authority.\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\n\n   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\n\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\nWednesday.\n\"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\n\"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of\nwhy its units were off line.\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\nG_nther A.

    "body": "George,\n\nThe probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted \nto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could \nnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more \ntowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One \nwing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 \nkid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + \nguestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This \nplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the \ncourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor \nliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. \n The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass \nskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have \nsingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  \n\nI don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would \nlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I \nwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I \nwould like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we \ndidn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. \n\nCall or email to let me know if this would work for you.  \npallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)\n\n\nPhillip Allen\n\n\nPS.

    "body": "Jeff,\n\nBefore you write off the stage, a few things to think about.\n\n1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \nrepairs.\n\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \nonsite.\n\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\n\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\n\nMy job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property \ndefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\n\n\nSales Price  705,000\n\n1st Lien   473,500\n\n2nd Lien  225,000\n\nTransfer fee    7,500\n\nCash required   14,500\n\n\nNOI   100,000\n\n1st Lien    47,292\n\n2nd Lien   23,694\n\nCash flow  29,014\n\nCash on cash  200%\n\n\nThese numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \ncash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the \nadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years \nfor a higher price.\n\nDo you want to reconsider?  Let me know.\n\nPhillip",

Cash Needs\nHighlights:\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\nplete=20\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\ns=20\nand other measures.=20\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\n.8=20\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\nII. Credit Relationships\nHighlights:\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\nlt.=20\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\nnd=20\npayable.\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\n=20\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\nits=20\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\n=20\nissues within the last three weeks.\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\nHighlights\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\n such=20\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\nHighlights\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\n=20\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\nTotal                                             $ 460\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\n=20\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\nom=20\ncontract employees.\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\n=20\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\nActivity)\nHighlights:\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\n=20\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\ne=20\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\n=20\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\nD.01-01-018.\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\nTURN Proposal\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\nRN=20\nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\ns.=20\nOur comments are summarized as follows:\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\nt=20\nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\nThe Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\nift=20\ncosts between two regulatory assets.\nTURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\n the=20\nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\nin=20\nthe TRA is overstated.\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\nHighlights:\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\n=20\npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\n=20\nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\n=20\nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\non=20\nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\nve=20\nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\n[there is no Section VII]\n=20\nVIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\nSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=\n=20\nmillion annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20\nIn 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=\n=20\nThis increase correlates to the increase in market prices\nfor natural gas for the same period.\nA copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20\nwww.cpuc.ca.gov.\n=20\nDan",

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule \nmust be discussed and agreed upon.\n\nFeel free to call me at home (713)463-8626\n\n\nPhillip",

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \ncomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \nwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \n(and maybe earlier).\n\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \nsome assurances of payment. \n\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \non 2/2/01.\n\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's \npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this \noccurred today.\n\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  \nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

    "body": "By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star\nDate: 01/20/01 22:15\n\nAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile \nExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas \nstorage number. \n\nThe storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the \nforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n\"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, \na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n\"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n\"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n\"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n\"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \nWednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider \nsome changes.\" \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star",

Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next \nfew months.\n\nTALKING POINTS:\n\nLot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there \nis a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED \nSOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.\nHuge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) \nThe SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.\nBankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.\n\nACTION ITEMS:\n\n1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy\n\nMichael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize \na Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super \nPriority.\n\n2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term\n\nSandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet \nS-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer \nto see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of \nApril).  Pat Boylston will develop \"public benefit\" language for options \nworking with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or \npgboylston@stoel.com.\n\n3. Get Team to Sacramento\n\nGet with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the \nmagnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  \n\n4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts\n\nSteve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or \nthougths.  Probably of limited value.\n\n5. Update List\n\nAny new information on this should be communicated to the following people as \nsoon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.\n\nENA Legal - Christian Yoder / Travis McCullough\nCredit - Michael Tribolet\nEES - Vicki Sharp / Don Black\nENA - Tim Belden / Philip Allen\nGovt Affairs - Steve Kean / Richard Shapiro",

    "body": "George,\n\nHere is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders \nprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule \nmust be discussed and agreed upon.\n\nFeel free to call me at home (713)463-8626\n\n\nPhillip",

In attendance were Ken Lay, \nthe Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \nproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \nbased on the governor's comments:\n\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \nthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \nwas a frequently recurring theme.\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \nbasis to consumers.\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \nCalifornia.\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \nwidely deploy distributed generation.\nExpand in-state gas production.\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \naddtional gas supplies.\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \nany one time.\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be \nable to help out here).\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \napproach with generators.\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's \nthoughts and get them to Kari)\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \nnot just the 5 one year strips.\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \ndeal.\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \nforward contracting issues.\nThanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.",

As I mentioned last week, I would like \nto find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not \nrequire the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to \nstructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.

I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this \nnature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to \npermanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be \nimportant to banks. \n\n I am faxing you a project summary.

If \nyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as recommendations, here is a short list:\n\n 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales \nabove monthly index without enough consideration of future \n      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\n                    This creates a shortage in later months.\n\n 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \ndemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \n                      Specific questions should include:  \n\n  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \nto fill storage?\n\n  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \nmuch gas from Socal's system.  \n       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \nown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than \ntheir injection capablity, but injected far less.\n\n 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short \nterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \n                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating \nrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market \nand the \n     consumer has benefitted.  \n\n\nCall me if you need any more input.\n\n\nPhillip",

Note that the\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\nstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\nof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\n\nAlso, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\nare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\nactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\nwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\n\nIt appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly\nsure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.\n\nI hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are\n$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\nbedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached\ngarages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat",

Any possibility for a=\n deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=\nans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=\nus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=\nans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=\nnce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=\n dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=\nislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=\ne details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=\ne.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=\ng-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=\nhat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =\nbreach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=\ne bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=\nll be very difficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=\ne would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=\n Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =\n$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=\nl disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=\n will support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=\nll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=\nk of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=\nr community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=\nended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=\nntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =\npaid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=\nkely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20\n=20\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=\nans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =\nthe General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =\nof the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=\nicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=\n to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=\nrtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=\nications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n=20\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B\nLenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B\n=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B\n=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M\nTax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%\n=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%\nCurrent Projected=20\nBlended IR:=09=095.38%\nMaturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=\nhe California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=\n authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=\nhorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=\ntional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =\ngoing forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=\nations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =\nhas  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =\nthat must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=\nurther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =\nis clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=\ning power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=\nornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=\ndered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=\nier in the crisis.\n=20\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=\nhe first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=\ngust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=\no sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=\nigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=\ns and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=\nes that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=\nruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20\n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=\nsuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=\ntating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=\nen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=\nate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=\nassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=\n bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=\n the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",

    "subject": "Investment Structure",
    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000 \n01:29 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"Claudia L. Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat",

Temperatures\ncould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.\n     \"Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of\nthe morning,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"By options expiration\nthe market had pretty much dried up.\"\n     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main\nreason for the decline in spot market prices.\n     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the\nNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million\nBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since\nMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of\n$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts\nindicated reduced utility load requirements.\n     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they\nnormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather\nforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.\n     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13\nhigher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the\n$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-\n$92.00.\n     ~\n-Karyn Rispoli\n\n\nMid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices\n\n     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent\nnext-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised\nwarmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.\n     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the\nCincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19\nto $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the\nmarket opened down to $59.00 after options expired.\n     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on\nthe Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower\non average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17\nlower at $65.00-$100.00.\n     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted\nhigh temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal\nin Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven\ndays, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.\n     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled\nprices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent\nelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired\ngeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.\n     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average\nof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British\nthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average\nof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.\n     \"The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got\npeople coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"These are much\nmore realistic prices.\"\n     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the\noutlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for\ndelivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00\nyesterday.\n     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged\nwith warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission\ncapacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in\nsouthern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.\n     \"What's happening is the people who don't have firm\ntransmission are getting into the market early and buying at those\nhigh prices since they have no choice,\" one MAPP trader said.\n     \"Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a\nfirm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices\nfell off,\" he said, \"and bought from them at those lower prices,\ncausing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.\"\n\n-Ken Fahnestock\n\n\nSoutheast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast\n\n     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast\nU.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was\nforecast for the region this week, traders said.\n     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since\nmany large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures\nclimb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.\n     \"There was nothing going on in Florida today,\" said one\nsouthern energy trader. \"Everything was going to markets in the\nnorth.\"\n     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into\nmarkets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority\ngrid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.\n     \"Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as\nforecasts came out,\" said on Entergy power trader. \"Prices,\ndeclined to $60 and less.\"\n     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95\nto $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades\nwere noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent\nestimates.\n     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather\nforecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week\ncaused prices to decline in the region.\n     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was\nthe main culprit behind lower prices.\n     \"The cold weather's backing off,\" said one SPP utility\ntrader. \"It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and\ntoday it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was\nbitter cold and today it was just plain cold.\"\n     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though\nthe Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern\nSPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.\n\n-Brian Whary\n\n\n\nU.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand\n\n     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in\nthe U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to\nincrease household consumption for space heating, traders said.\n     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the\nElectricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01\npounds a megawatt-hour.\n     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees\nto 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services\nCorp. in the U.S.\n     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15\npounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.\n     December continued to fall amid a combination of position\nclosing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will\nnot rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.\n     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.\n     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with\nexpectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue\nto stifle demand, traders said.\n     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.\n     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.\n     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer\n2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.\nWinter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour.\n     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely\nforce many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-\nup to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will\nprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more\neasily be assessed.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n\n\nNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast\n\n     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices\non the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today\nas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.\n     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-\nhour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076\nmegawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446\nmegawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.\n     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after\nforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for\nnext week. These producers typically generate power to prevent\nreservoirs from overflowing.\n     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise\nwith falling temperatures because of increased requirements for\nspace heating.\n     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active\ntrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders\nsaid.\n     \"The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,\" a\nStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have been\nselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should\nnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"\n     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall\nbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited\nchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather\nServices Corp. in the U.S.\n     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was\nexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict\ntemperatures to begin falling.\n     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22\npercent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell\n4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.\n     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise\nby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.\n     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-\nterm contracts.\n     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,\n1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a\nmegawatt-hour.\n     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although\nexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers\nto meet the increased demand, other traders said.\n     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,\nwill delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.\n     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used\ntoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT\n=0F$\n\n\n - daily.pdf",

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

    "subject": "Investment Structure",
    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 \n04:28 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"Claudia L. Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat",

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 \n04:26 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"Claudia L. Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat",

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000 \n04:35 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\n\n\nEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\nthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/11/2000 \n04:57 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\n\n\nEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\nthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated \nthat he had more units under construction that would be \n available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different \nfrom yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor\n plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  \n\n As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  \n\n Call or email with your thoughts.\n\nPhillip",

Exodus is now wrapping up \nconstruction\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \na mile from its\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. \"That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \nheads. \n\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \nUtilities and\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \ndata centers. The\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing \nresidential and business\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \nnecessary to support\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \nmillion each,\n                  Karzmar said. \n\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \nbring up the data center\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \n\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \nbusinesses and schools in the\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \n\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \nappetite for power --\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \nfacilities run 24 hours a\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \nconstant revenue\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \nthey could\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \nexpenditures. \n\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \nmean for power rates\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \n\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \nCity Light. \n\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \nlights at the football\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \nWe have data\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \nand 50 megawatts.\" \n\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \ncomplex in Tukwila is\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \nthe 1.35 million\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \nBoeing Space &\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \n92 percent of the\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \ncompanies. \n\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \nCommunications,\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \nNetworks all\n                  lease space in the office park. \n\n                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \nSabey has become an\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \nmanagement or\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \nclaims his firm is\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \nthe country. \n\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \nbandwidth-heavy tasks\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \nco-location space in\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \n\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \nspace is growing at a\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \ncausing similar\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \nCalifornia. \n\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \nspace, plans to nearly\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \nWhile companies\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \nhigh-tech companies\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \nas Exodus that\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \nmanagement. \n\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \nconstruction and we plan to\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \ndemand right now\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \nexecutive at Exodus in\n                  Seattle. \n\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \nin the local utility\n                  industry perplexed. \n\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \nto serve the growth,\"\n                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is \nalmost stunned by this, in\n                  a way.\"",

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team\nSelection information.\n\nIdeally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form\nwe sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the\ndatabase directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the\nability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still\nrequire additional information.\n\nWe need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot\nemail them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can\nwe send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have\neach person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.\n\nSo, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need\nto instead, provide the needed information via email.\n\nThank you for your assistance Phillip.\n\nChristi L.

I have asked Zimin Lu \n(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they \nwill be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this \nmeeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is \ncomfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those \nwho are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have \nheard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to \ndiscuss them.\n\nPlease let me know if you are unable to attend.",

Could you \ngive me a basis for the period :\n\nSept -00 - May 31, 2006\nSept-00 - May 31, 2008\n\nSince I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off \nMalin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an \nadjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread \nbe on these terms.\n\nThanks, Mike",

 If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS \ninformation, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed \nas soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days \nago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to \ncall Ted Bland @ 3-5275.\n\nWith Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees \nbetween operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to \nhave one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee \ndata.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the \nyear-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC \nrequests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their \nprofiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education \nneed to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is \naccessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to \nhrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com \non the command line of your browser.\n\nThe target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would \nlike to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned \nfor input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please \ncontact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  \n\nYour  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave",

The \nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \nthe generation side.\n\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \nthey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \nothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas \ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \nespecially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the \nUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal \nconsumer then it is obviously a different story.\n\nLet's talk.",

    "body": "Al,\n\nI was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds \nlike you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your \nemail all is well with you.   That's great.  \n\nWe did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  \nWhat's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike \nriding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.\n\nMy fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on \nmaintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical \ncyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  \nHe never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial \nPark on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the \nroad.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.\n\nI would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch \nsometime.  \n\nPhillip",

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/30/2000 \n01:32 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Colleen Sullivan                           05/30/2000 09:18 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Transport p&l\n\nPhillip--\nI've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange \nto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI'll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019.   \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \ncase there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the \nvolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. \n \nDeal #  251327                  159540                   265229         \n106300   201756\nP&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)          \n($2,769)   ($273)\nRec:   Ques/Clay Basin/0184   NWPL/Opal 543  NWPL/Opal   Sumas      NWPL/S of \nGr Rvr\nDel:   NWPL/S of Green River/Clay   Ques/Clay Basin/0852   Ques/Clay \nBasin/0852   Ques/Clay Basin    Ques/Clay Basin\n1        329       8,738\n2     1,500\n3         2,974    11,362\n4         6,741    12,349       1,439\n5       19,052          3,183\n9            333\n13  30,863       2,680\n14  30,451    \n15  35,226    \n16         6,979              235 \n17  17,464     \n18    9,294     \n20  10,796          771\n21  17,930     \n22  10,667     \n23       14,415          9,076\n25  23,934       8,695\n26     3,284     \n27         1,976\n28     1,751     \n29     1,591     \n30  20,242",

They were polite regarding \nasset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to \nlisten to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to \nprotect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality \nagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable \nus to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder \nvalue by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by \nreducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a \nweather product.\n\nAs to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other \ncandidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy \nto ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our \nopportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we \nimplement our strategy in California.\n\nAre there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset \nmanagement deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to \nsystematically identify and work through all the candidates. \n\nLaird",

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird",

The data I have received thus far are summarized in the \nfollowing paragraphs.\n\nThe approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or \ncurtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.\n\nThe approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations \nor purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.\n\nA note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a \nlot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.\n\nDon Badley",

The book\ncovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.\n\nI find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -\ninteresting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years\nlearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,\nstructures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have\nlasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good\nbackground information for sustainable builder folks.\n\nThank you, Mr. Moore.

Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.\nspot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply\noutstripped demand.\n     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak\npower dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-\nhour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.\n     \"Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing\nprices to decline,\" said one Southwest trader.\n     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington\nMassachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach\n75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.\n     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank\n$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as\ntraders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.\n     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt\nPalo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased\nproduction to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a\nscheduled refueling outage that began March 31.\n     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power\nslumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a\nBloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.\n     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,\ntemperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees\nFahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling\ndemand 84 percent below normal.\n     \"We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is\ncausing temperatures to drop,\" said one Northwest trader.\n     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak\npower fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at\n$175.00-$228.00.\n     According the California Independent System Operator today's\nforecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743\nmegawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.\n\n-Robert Scalabrino\n\n\nNortheast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand\n\n     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in\navailable generation coupled with less weather-related demand,\ncaused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much\nas 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.\n     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,\ntemperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree\nFahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and\ncooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.\n     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak\npower scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg\nvolume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from\nFriday.\n     \"There's just no weather out there,\" said one PJM-based\ntrader. \"There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for\nheating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week\nlong.\"\n     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000\nmegawatts through Friday.\n     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for\nthe dip.

Cooler weather is\nexpected to begin Wednesday.\n     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,\ntemperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,\npropelling air conditioning demand, traders said.\n      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council\nregional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from\nequivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.\nTrades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.\n     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an\naverage of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid\ntrades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.\n     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm\nenergy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders\ncomplained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.\n     \"There's just no overnight load to do anything with the\nsupply we have,\" said one Texas-based utility power trader.\n\"Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree\n(Fahrenheit) days.

Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition\nfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting\nprice levels, traders said.\n     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was\nexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production\ncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.\n     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after\nlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.\n     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas\nfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15\npence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since\nthe start of last week.\n     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental\nreasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the\nmarket, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.\nMost trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,\nthey said.\n\n-Amal Halawi\n\n\nNordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest\n\n     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term\nelectricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,\nNorway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed\nto buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid\nlimited hydro-supply, traders said.\n     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all\ntime high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00\nmegawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.\nWinter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-\n214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.\n     \"The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now\nyou have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-\nbased trader said. \"I'm surprised that even at the peak of the\nsnow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are\nsteadily climbing.''\n     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent\nabove normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.\nStill, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a \"more\nrealistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet\noutlooks.''\n     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations\nof 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,\ndown 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was\na \"high'' spot price for this time of the year.\n     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour\nwith 140 megawatts exchanged.\n     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours\ngeneration, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.\n\n-Alejandro Barbajosa\n-0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT\n=0F$\n\n\n - daily.pdf",

Any possibility for a \ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \ndifficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \ndisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the \ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should \nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n \nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n \nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\nCurrent Projected \nBlended IR:  5.38%\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \nidea  earlier in the crisis.\n \nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.",

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook \nclient will be configured on your computer.\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail \nvia Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is \nconfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is \nmigrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your \nweb browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and \nTo-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook \nclient is configured on your desktop.\n\n2. Remote access to your mailbox.\nAfter your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) \nfor remote access to your mailbox.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while \nconnecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA \navailable from your home or when traveling abroad.\n\nHOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\n\nLaunch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  \nhttp://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\n\nSubstitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You \nwill be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user \nid\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You \nwill now be able to view your mailbox.\n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between \nthe Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things \nin OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the \nfunctions NOT available via OWA:\n\nFeatures NOT available using OWA:\n\n-  Tasks\n-  Journal\n-  Spell Checker\n-  Offline Use\n-  Printing Templates\n-  Reminders\n-  Timed Delivery\n-  Expiration\n-  Outlook Rules\n-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall\n-  Sharing Contacts with others\n-  Task Delegation\n-  Direct Resource Booking\n-  Personal Distribution Lists\n\nQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\n\nIf you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the \nOutlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:\n\n Outlook.2000@enron.com\n\nOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:\n\n 713-853-1411\n\nThank you,\n\nOutlook 2000 Migration Team",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \nout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \nif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \nagenda.

    "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2001 \n05:50 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Stephen Swain                           04/10/2001 11:58 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt \nMotley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris \nMallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nSean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill Williams \nIII/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: CAISO demand reduction\n\nPhillip et al.,\n\nI have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in \nthe West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \nquestions or need any further information.",

Center Garage\n\nThe Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.\n\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\n\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \nemployee cost of $94.00.\n\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \nas spaces become available. \n\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \n\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \ngarage.\n\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \n\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)",

As you can see even \nreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only \ngenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about \nsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down \nto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.

Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less \nand cost about the same?\n\n2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory \njoist?\n\n3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?\n\n4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What \ntype of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or \nCellulose?\n\n5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?\n\n6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know \nthe difference between an apron and a stool.\n\n7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent \ncracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?\n\n8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial \none out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.\n\n9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under \nthe stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.\n\n10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount \nstainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.\n\n11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.\n\n12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?\n\n13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?\n\n14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron \nrailings?\n\n15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except \nfor change orders?\n\nI want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but \nthis is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to \ncall Cary Kipp to\nsee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.\n\nPhillip\nI",

My only comment is that George and Larry might \nobject to the language that \"the bank that was requested to finance the \nconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs \nof the construction of the Project\".   Technically, that bank lowered the \nloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of \nequity that would be required. \n\nDid I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.\n\nRegarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, \nengineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are \nin a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking \ndirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on \nwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  \n\nThe obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we \nneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and \ngive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.\n\nPhillip",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\nBut that still wasn't enough juice.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\n$250/MWh price cap.\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\nPowerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\nWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\nwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\nDorinson said.\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\nthe high-priced power.\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\nPwr Plant\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\nCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\nISO.\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\ncollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling\nblackouts.\nThe ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),\nReliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).\nDuke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives\nin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.\n\n\n   -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line\nPower Plants\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\n\n   By Jessica Berthold\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said\nWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by\nsome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate\nreasons.\nThe California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power\ngrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public\nUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power\nplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,\nISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nThe state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for\nunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency\nfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and\ncustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be\ncalled on to do so.\nAs reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)\nsaid they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday\nevening.\nRepresentatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES\nand Dynegy Tuesday evening.\nAES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection\nof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday\nmorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron\nThomas said.\nThomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives\nreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.\n\n   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits\n\nThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have\nused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\nThomas said.\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\nand Redondo Beach plants.\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\n\"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\"\nThomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\ndistrict's\" authority.\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\n\n   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\n\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\nWednesday.\n\"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\n\"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of\nwhy its units were off line.\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\nG_nther A.

This is unfortunate because she \nhas been a very valuable member of our team over the last few years and has \nbeen instrumental in developing the Eastern Rockies trading business and \nproviding our customers with excellent service.  Nicole is not leaving to go \nto a competitor, but is going to spend more time with her family.  Given this \nfact, you probably want to speed up the transition. \n\nCall me and we can discuss.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\tJay Reitmeyer@ECT\n\t03/16/2001 09:04 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Paul T Lucci/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Whitt/NA/Enron@Enron, Nicole \nCortez/NA/Enron@Enron, Theresa Staab/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike \nGrigsby/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Denver trading\n\nI would like to welcome Susan Scott to the West Desk and specifically to the \nEastern Rockies trading region.  The plan is for Susan to work with me in \nmoving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston.  Her \nspecific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and \nTheresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence.\n\nSusan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara.  She is also working \non understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different \ntrading points from Opal to the mid-continent.\n\nMy plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April \n22 - April 24).  I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during \nbid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time.  I will \nprobably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with \nus and the logistics team, maybe in early May.  Then, Susan and I will both \ngo to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to \ncomplete the transfer of operations to the Houston office.\n\nWe can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding \nreservations.\n\nThank you,\n\nJay",
